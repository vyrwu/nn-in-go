# nn-in-go
Mandatory mini-project for the Artificial Intelligence Programming course. The topic of the mini-project was chosen to 
be an implementation of a neural network model for supervised learning from scratch using only mathematical matrix 
transformations and a Golang programming language. The implementation and training data set of the Neural Network implemented for the mini-project was heavily 
 inspired by the aforementioned book. The report of the mini-project consists of a presentation of a Neural Network 
 Architecture that was chosen as model candidate for the implementation, the description of the data set chosen for 
 model training and validation, and the overview into programmed implementation of a neural network.
